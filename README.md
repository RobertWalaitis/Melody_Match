Melody Match: A Music Recommendation Software

Introduction
	There is an epidemic of people who struggle to find music that matches their taste or are struggling to look for new music to listen to. Without conducting extensive research, people are left in the dark about how to expand their music library. We will solve this issue by creating a music recommendation software, making music more accessible and enjoyable for listeners. Our software analyzes the users' current music preferences using identifiers such as genre, release year, artist, and song topic, and then outputs recommendations based on the songs provided to the software. This software will provide a fast and easy way for users to get music recommendations and start listening to them ASAP.

Objectives
Design a recommendation system that takes user song inputs.
Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore and refine music suggestions with filters.
Provide accurate, diverse, and personalized recommendations to improve music discovery.

Scope
	This project will be a prototype music recommendation software that has several features to help narrow down song suggestions. We will implement an input and return system with preference-based recommendations and a simple interface for interaction. It will not include large-scale deployment, partnerships with streaming services and artists, a full database with every existing song, or advanced AI models beyond what can be achieved within a semester project.

Proposed Solution
	We propose developing MelodyMatch, a recommendation software that collects user preferences (e.g., favorite artists, genres, and release years) and applies filtering and a recommendation algorithm to suggest new songs. The system is designed for casual music listeners seeking accessible ways to discover new music without extensive research. Recommendations will be displayed in a list where users can start listening. 

Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js 
Database: MySQL
Deployment Platform: GitHub Pages

Expected Outcomes
A functional prototype of the Melody Match recommendation system.
A user interface that allows users to enter preferences and view recommendations. 
A working recommendation algorithm that suggests new music based on input criteria.
Testing results show the effectiveness of the recommendations in helping users discover new songs.
